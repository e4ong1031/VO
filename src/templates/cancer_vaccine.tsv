Upon administration of the gp96-Ig-secreting allogeneic bladder cancer cell vaccine HS-410, the live, irradiated tumor cells continuously secrete gp96-Ig along with its chaperoned tumor associated antigens (TAAs). This enhances antigen cross presentation to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) and, upon expansion, leads to the induction of a potent CTL response against the TAAs on the endogenous bladder cancer cells. This vaccine also induces a memory T cell response that could fight recurring cancer cells. gp96-Ig is constructed by replacing the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequence of gp96 with the Fc portion of the IgG1 protein.
