The iCD40 contains a membrane-localized cytoplasmic CD40 domain fused to the FK506 modified drug-binding protein 12 (FKBP12). Upon intradermal administration of BPX-201, these DCs accumulate in local draining lymph nodes. Twenty-four hours after vaccination, the dimerizing agent AP1903 is administered. AP1903 binds to the drug binding domain, leading to iMC oligomerization and activation of iCD40 and MyD88-mediated signaling in iMC-expressing DCs. This signaling pathway activates the DCs and stimulates a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against host tumor cells that express PSMA. PSMA, a glycoprotein secreted by prostatic epithelial and ductal cells, is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and is used as a tumor marker for both diagnosis and treatment evaluation. MyD88 is involved in interleukin 1 receptor (IL1R) and toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling."			4999	VIOLIN: https://violinet.org/canvaxkb/vaccine_detail.php?c_vaccine_id=4999	https://github.com/vaccineontology/VO/issues/93			Ibrahim Seleznev|Eliyas Asfaw|Jie Zheng|Oliver He

After immunization with HER2 ECD+TM virus-like replicon particles vaccine AVX901, the VRPs infect cells and express HER2 ECD+TM protein that may activate the immune system to elicit a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HER2-expressing tumor cells. The alphaviral replicon of this vaccine is an attenuated strain of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) in which 3 of the 7 viral genes were substituted with a truncated HER2 gene to create a self-amplifying replicon RNA. HER2, a tyrosine kinase involved in several cell growth signaling pathways, is dysregulated or overexpressed in a wide variety of cancer cell types."			5442	VIOLIN: https://violinet.org/canvaxkb/vaccine_detail.php?c_vaccine_id=5442	https://github.com/vaccineontology/VO/issues/305			Justin Song|Penny Pan|Jie Zheng|Oliver He
